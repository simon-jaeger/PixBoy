With PixBoy, you can quickly and easily create your own Game Boy sprites. Use the limited color palette to draw on the 16x16 canvas. Add a title and an optional description.

There is no dedicated **eraser**. To erase part of your drawing, simply use the lightest shade to draw over the existing pixels.

On mobile devices, the use of a stylus is recommended.
